# Collaborative To-Do List Project

## üöÄ Overview
This project simulates a real-world **Git collaboration workflow**, allowing contributors to work on a shared codebase using branching strategies, pull requests, and conflict resolution. It is designed to build foundational skills necessary for modern DevOps workflows.

## üéØ Objectives
- Learn and implement Git branching workflows (`main`, `dev`, feature branches).
- Understand how to create pull requests and manage merges.
- Resolve merge conflicts in a collaborative environment.
- Gain hands-on experience with version control best practices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
- **Git**: For version control.
- **GitHub**: For collaboration, pull requests, and repository hosting.

```## üìÇ Repository Structure

````markdown
collaborative-todo-list/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md       # Project documentation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ task.md         # File added during feature development

## üìù How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to replicate the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/AnunukemSam/collaborative-todo-list.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd collaborative-todo-list
    ```

3. **Create a New Branch**: Use a meaningful name for your branch, such as `feature-add-task`:
    ```bash
    git checkout -b feature-add-task
    ```

4. **Make Changes and Commit**: Add or edit files, then stage and commit your changes:
    ```bash
    echo "This is a new task for the to-do list." > task.md
    git add .
    git commit -m "Added a new task file"
    ```

5. **Push Changes to GitHub**: Push your branch to the remote repository:
    ```bash
    git push -u origin feature-add-task
    ```

6. **Create a Pull Request**:
    - Go to the GitHub repository in your browser.
    - Click the "Compare & pull request" button.
    - Add a description and submit the pull request.

7. **Merge the Pull Request**: Once the pull request is reviewed, merge it into the `dev` branch.

8. **Handle Conflicts (if any)**: If there are merge conflicts, resolve them locally:
    ```bash
    git pull origin dev
    # Fix conflicts in your code editor
    git add .
    git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
    git push
    ```

### Key Learnings
- **Branching Best Practices**: Maintain a structured workflow using main for production, dev for integration, and feature branches for new development.
- **Pull Requests**: Facilitate code reviews and collaborative development.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle real-world scenarios where multiple contributors work on the same files.
- **Git Commands**: Deepen understanding of commands like `git checkout`, `git merge`, and `git push`.
