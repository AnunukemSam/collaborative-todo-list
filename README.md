# Collaborative To-Do List Project

## 🚀 Overview
This project simulates a real-world **Git collaboration workflow**, allowing contributors to work on a shared codebase using branching strategies, pull requests, and conflict resolution. It is designed to build foundational skills necessary for modern DevOps workflows.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Learn and implement Git branching workflows (`main`, `dev`, feature branches).
- Understand how to create pull requests and manage merges.
- Resolve merge conflicts in a collaborative environment.
- Gain hands-on experience with version control best practices.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Git**: For version control.
- **GitHub**: For collaboration, pull requests, and repository hosting.

## 📂 Repository Structure
```plaintext
collaborative-todo-list/
├── README.md       # Project documentation
├── task.md         # File added during feature development

## 📝 How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to replicate the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnunukemSam/collaborative-todo-list.git

## 📝 How to Run the Project

Follow these steps to replicate the project:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the GitHub repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AnunukemSam/collaborative-todo-list.git

2. Navigate to the Project Directory:

cd collaborative-todo-list


3. Create a New Branch: Use a meaningful name for your branch, such as feature-add-task:

git checkout -b feature-add-task


4. Make Changes and Commit: Add or edit files, then stage and commit your changes:

echo "This is a new task for the to-do list." > task.md
git add .
git commit -m "Added a new task file"


5. Push Changes to GitHub: Push your branch to the remote repository:

git push -u origin feature-add-task


6. Create a Pull Request:

Go to the GitHub repository in your browser.

Click the "Compare & pull request" button.

Add a description and submit the pull request.



7. Merge the Pull Request: Once the pull request is reviewed, merge it into the dev branch.


8. Handle Conflicts (if any): If there are merge conflicts, resolve them locally:

git pull origin dev
# Fix conflicts in your code editor
git add .
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
git push



### Key Points to Ensure It Works:

1. The commands are inside **triple backticks (` ``` `)** to preserve formatting as code blocks.
2. There are **no comments in the code block** that would break the Markdown.
3. Each command or instruction step is formatted clearly.

### Instructions for GitHub:
1. Replace your existing "How to Run the Project" section in your README with this one.
2. Commit the changes and then check it on GitHub. It should render correctly without showing any issues.

Let me know if this works for you, or if anything is still unclear!
